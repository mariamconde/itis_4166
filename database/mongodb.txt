MongoDB
- Each data record is stored as a document
- A document is composed of field-and-value pairs

{
    name: "Sue",
    age: 26,
    status: "A",
    groups: ["news", "sports"]
}

Documents are stored in collections
- collections are analogous to tables in relational databases
- a database contains a set of collections

BSON vs JSON

documents are viewed in JSON format
{
    name: "sue",
    age: 26,
    status: "A",
    groups: ["news", "sports"]
}

Documents are store din BSON form 
BSON is a binary representation of JSON
-faster to parse and lighter to store than JSON
-supports more data types than JSON

_id field
- every document has a unique _id field, acting as the primary key
- the _id field can be of any type other than array
- can always update document but cannot update field

ObjectId values are 12 bytes in length
- 4 byte timestamp value
- 5 byte random value
- 3 byte increment counter
