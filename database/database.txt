To provide persistent data storage, a web application uses databases to store data.
The following notes gives an introduction to database. In particular, it discusses and 
compares two types of database: relational vs. NoSQL. 


-- Database --
* used to store a collection of data
* All access to the database is controlled by the databasr management system  (DBMS)

    Application -> Database Management System  (DBMS) -> Database


-- Relational Database --
* Popular since 1980s
* Data is organized as a set of tables with columns and rows

* Exponential growth of internet and web applications requires 
- scale to store, organize and process massive amount of data
- data can be semi-structured or unstructured

- data is normalized
- stored in different tables
- would take a long time to join
- higher response time 
- strict schema

relational database usually use verttical scaling method
horizontal scaling: spread data into several different machines

-- NoSQL Database --
NoSQL (Not only SQL)
database are developed as an alternative

* key-value : stored as a kew value pair
* Graph DB : stored as node in the graph edges descirbe relationship in data
* Columnn Family : for each column in rlational database stored together, when querying don't need all the information or a particular record
* Document : documetsn grouped in collectiors


- horizontal scaling with replicaton and distribution over commodity servers
- if application has high volume workloads NoSQL is a better option
- uses flexible dynamic schema to handle unstructured data

Database for Node/Express applications
- use any database supported by NODEJS
- Relational database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite
- NoSQL database: Redis, Cassandra, CouchDB, MongoDB, Neo4J
