Authentication

The process of verifying the user is who they claim to be. There are safety measures that we must implement 
to secure user authentication.

User name must be stored case insensitive
- when a user signs up, convert the user name to lower case before storing it in the database
- when a user logs in, convert the user name to lower case and comparw it the one stored in the database

Enforce password strength requirements
- min password length should be at least 8 characters
- max password length should be at least 64 characters

Store passwords in a secure fashion
- store hashed and salted passwords instead of plaintext passwords, eg use bcrypt to hash the passwords

Limit authentication requests to protect against network based guessing attacks
- express-rate-limit package can be used to limit repeated authentication requests
