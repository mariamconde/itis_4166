Schema Validation

Validators are rules defined in schemas
Mongoose has serveral built in validators

All SchemaTypes have the required Validators 
- the field must be provided if required is ser to true

Numbers has min and max validators 
String have the following validators
- enum: specifies the set of allowed values for the field
- match: specifies a regualr expression that the string must match
- minLength and maxLength

Validation on Insert
By default, documents are validated before they are saved to the database

Before saving the document, the validate() method is called which chcks validation rules

- if validation rule is violated, save is aborted and the error is return
- otherwise, the document will be inserted in the database
- you can set schema's validateBeforeSave to fall to bypass validation

Validate on Update
supports validation for update operations
- update validators are off by default, and can be turned on by setting runValidators to true when calling update methods
