What is Mongoose?

- popular object document mapper for MongoDB
- Mongoose is built on top of the MongoDB native Node driver
- Impose a structure on documents through schema and schema validations
    - Require documents to follow the same structure and follow the same schema
- Maps MongoDB documents into objects in the application code
- Performs type casting

Schema
- Defines the format for all documents in a collection
- Defines the properties that the document6s can have 
    - ex: name (major) , type (string) , default values, validators (rules to validate document s before embedded)
- Allowed Schema types: String, Number, Date, Buffer, Boolean, Mixed, ObjectId, Arrau

Example

Schema Constructor
- definition: object describing schema paths 
- takes 2 arguments
- options: object describing options

const userSchema = new Schema ({
    name: String,
    age: Number
});

Model
- compiled schema, which is used to create and access on documents stored in the correspondong collection
- call mongoose.model() method to create a model
- the method takes 2 arguments
    - first argument: name of the model
    - second argument: name of the schema that the model is based on


const userSchema = new Schema ({
    name: String,
    age: Number
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema)

- Each model corresponds to a collection in the database, and the name of the collection is plural
  lowercased version of the model name 
- The correspondong collection name in this example is - users

Constructing documents
- Instance of a model
- Create a document by passing JavaScript object as an argument to the model
- Mongoose will
    - strip out any properties that are not defined in the schema
    - cast the values to match the tyoes defined in the schema

Example

const userSchema = new Schema ({
    name: String,
    age: Number
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema)

const user = new User ({
    name: 'Billy Pilgrim', 
    age: '64',
    rank: 'private'
});

console.log(user.name); //Billy Pilgrim
console.log(user.age); //64
console.log(user.rank); //undefined
//Mongoose strips out `rank` because it is not defined in the schema
