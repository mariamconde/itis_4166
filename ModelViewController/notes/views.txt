Views

- Include ejs template and static html fields
- same layout

layout
- the only difference is the content area
- nav and footer are the same
- instead of using the same code, create shared components using partials

partials
- a partial can be included in other view templates
- partials are usually stored in '/views/partials' folder

Include partials in other views by calling 
<%-include ('Relative/PATH/TO/FILE')%>

For example
<%- iclude ('./partials/header.ejs')%>
