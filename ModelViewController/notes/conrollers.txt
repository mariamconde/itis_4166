Controllers
- located in the center of the architecture
- components that connect everything together
- usually recieve request from the routes, based on the request read or write data
- forward data to view template then render to client side

A controller functiin is a callback function in thee routes
app.get('/stories', (req, res) => {});
- get all stories from the model
- pass all stories to template engine (html page)
- html page returned to the client 

A controller module includes all the callback functions from the same route module
- naming conventions:
    - index: GET /stories
    - new: GET/stories/new
    - create: POST /stories
    - show: GET /stories/:id
    - edit: GET /stories/:id/edit
    - update: PUT /stories/:id
    - delete: DELETE /stories/:id

The controller module exports all the controller functions so that they can be used in the route module
