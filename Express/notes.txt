-- What is Express? --
web framework built on top of the node http module
- minimalist (minimal functionalities)
    - handle request
    - interpret request message
    - generate responses
(Does not provide additional functionalities)
    - authenticate users, authorize users use sessions
    - might need to use a 3rd party library to do so
- unopiniated
    - does not define how to do certain things
    - template engines

-- As compared to vanilla NODE API, Express --
    - provides an easy way to handle routing, interpret requests, and generate responses
    - uses template engine for rendering dynamic HTML views
    - uses middleware for sessions, authenticaton, authorizatiom, input validation, etc
^       - does not support these functionalities (3rd party libraries to implement them)

-- Install Express package --

1. require the Express module

const express = require('express');

2. create an Express application

const app = express();

3.  bind the app to a particular port number

app.listen(port, host, () => {
});

-- Route Handling --
express defines routes in the following structure:
app.Method(path, handler);

Method is an HTTP request method, thus it can be get, post, put, delete, etc
- path is a path on the server
- route handlers is a function, which will be executed when the method and path matches incoming request

example:
// handle GET request at '/'

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!');
});
