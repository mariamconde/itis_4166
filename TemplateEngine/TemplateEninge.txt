Why Template Engine?
json is not meant for human reading (not user friendly)

is a tool that can used to generate HTML files by replacing variables in a static template file at runtime

- takes 2 inputs : template file and data
- template engines can run code snippets in template file
- with a template engine, we only need to create one template file to render all of the products

EJS Template Engine
- Embedded JavaScript
- has extension of .ejs and it is just an HTML file with embedded JavaScript code

<% if (user) { %>
    <p> Welcome, <%= user.name %></p>
<% } %>
- To generate an HTML file, EJS template engine
    - replaces what inside <%=%> with its literal value
    - executes the script between <% %> tags

    - install the ejs package
    - require ejs
    - set view engine: app.set('view engine', 'ejs')
    - create view templates and store them in the views folder
    - in route handler, call res.render() method and pass the view template and the sata as arguments
